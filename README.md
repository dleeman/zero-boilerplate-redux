# Zero Boilerplate Redux

A common criticism of Redux is that it requires writing a lot of boilerplate.
This is an application that is meant to show a sophisticated CRUD webapp that
is built using nearly zero Redux boilerplate.

### Technologies used

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) for
  scaffolding
- [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) for routing
- [Redux Resource](https://github.com/jmeas/redux-resource/) for managing
  resource data

### Forms

If you're building a CRUD application, you likely need to work with a lot of
forms. For simplicity's sake, this project doesn't use a forms library.

Two forms libraries that are worth looking into are:

- [`react-redux-form`](https://davidkpiano.github.io/react-redux-form/docs.html)
- [redux-form](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form)
